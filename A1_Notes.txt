Use send() and recv() not sendto() and recvfrom()

if (send(new_fd, "Hello world"  ... is the part we will use 
if ((numbytes = recv( 		... ditto 
Swap them around. Cleint sends, server receives. 

Example code only does one read. You must use loops to do more (you'll need a loop(s) in the client and a loop(s) in the server). There should also be checks (use numbytes).

fork() needs to be used so multiple people can send data simultaneously (the built in example forks alreayd, I think).
